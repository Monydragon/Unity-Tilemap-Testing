Resizing POP! Base sprites and facesets for use in RPG Maker
A Quick Guide
-----------------------------------------------

Using Gimp -

	Open the file using Gimp

	Select Image > Scale Image
	Set the "Image Size" drop tab to "%" and set both Width and Height to
	200% for RPG Maker VX Ace or 300% for RPG Maker MV
	Under "Quality", set "Interpolation" to "None" and click on "Scale"

	Export the image to .png using File > Export

	And you're all done!

Using Photoshop -

	Open the file using Photoshop

	Select Image > Image Size
	Set the Pixel Dimensions drop boxes to "Percent" and set both Width and
	Height to 200% for RPG Maker VX Ace or 300% for RPG Maker MV
	From the drop tab at the bottom, beneath "Resample Image:" select
	"Nearest Neighbor (preserve hard edges)" and click on "OK"

	Save the file as a .png using either "Save" or "Save As"

	And you're all done!


Note - if you have POP! resources already formatted for VX Ace and wish to
resize them for use in RPG Maker MV, follow the same steps as above, but
resize by 150% for both Width and Height.
