Tileset notes:
The tilesets in this resource pack requires an intermediate amount of knowledge of using the engine's mapping editor and event options.
 
- The Sewers set needs shift mapping to be functional.

- Shift click is absolute copy/paste tiles without affecting any autotile structures of the surroundings. 
*When there is no shift clicked tile in the clipboard, if you shift left click it'll put the absolutely middle part of that autotile which means no edges no corners.
*Shift Right Click is basically copying whatever it is on that tile including all layers.
*Shift Left Click will paste the copied tile(s) by Shift Right Click.

- Using the smoke graphics might require heavy modifications by the user. It onlt works for chimneys from the left.
- If you are confused on how some event functigons work.
